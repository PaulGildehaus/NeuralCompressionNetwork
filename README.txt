This is a project for my own understanding of neural networks and is for enjoyment. It has the potential to be too difficult for myself and being discontinued, however I am going to give it my all. If you would like to learn more about it, please look at the Vision and Design documents on the GitHub repository. 

Feel free to fork and contribute yourself, email me if you would like to be added to the project's contributors and get any updates from myself.
